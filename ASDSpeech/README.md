# ASDSpeech

This algorithm estimates autism severity from speech recordings. The algorithm is based on a convolutional neural network that was trained with speech recordings of Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd edition (ADOS-2) assessments from 136 children with autism. Speech segments of the children were manually annotated, individual vocalizations were separated, and a set of 49 accoustic and conversational features were extracted. The algorithm was tested on independent recordings from 61 additional children with autism who completed two ADOS-2 assessments, separated by 1-2 years.

## Folders organization
•	`./code`: python files that are used to train the model (`.code/main_script.py`) and test the two time-points datasets (`./code/estimate_recs_trained_mdl.py`).

•	`./config`: the configuration files: `./config/config_file.yaml `used for training and `./config/config/config_file_trained_mdl.yaml` used for testing on the 61 children.

•	`./data`: includes .mat (Matlab) file of the extracted features of the training datasets (`./data/train_data.mat`) and separate .mat files for all 122 recordings in the test datasets in the format <rec_name>.mat, the lists of recordings names of the 61 children in the test datasets (`./data/data_T1.yaml` and `./data/data_T2.yaml`), and the Excel files of the test datasets that include children characteristics (age, severity scores, gender. `./data/data_T1_info.xlsx` and `./data/data_T2_info.xlsx`).

•	`./results`: includes all the trained models for each target score (SA, RRB, total ADOS) for each iteration (model and weights) and the estimated scores (.txt files).

## Data
The database includes matrices of the features extracted from the 136 children who participated in a single ADOS-2 assessment and 61 children who participated in two ADOS-2 assessments separated by 1–2 years (two recordings each), yielding 258 ADOS-2 assessments in total. All ADOS-2 assessments were performed by a clinician with research reliability. In addition, all participating children had ASD diagnoses confirmed by a developmental psychologist, child psychiatrist, or pediatric neurologist, according to the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). 

## Recording setup

All recordings were performed during ADOS-2 assessments using a single microphone (CHM99, AKG, Vienna) located on a wall, ~1–2m from the child, and connected to a sound card (US-16x08, TASCAM, California). Each ADOS-2 session lasted ~40 minutes and was recorded at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, 16 bits/sample (down-sampled to 16 kHz). The audio recordings were manually divided and labeled as child, therapist, parent, simultaneous speech (i.e., speech of more than one speaker), or noise (e.g., movements in the room) segments. All remaining segments were automatically labeled as silent. Only child-labeled segments were used in further analysis. These segments included speech, laughing, moaning, crying, and screaming. To assess the utility of these features for estimating ADOS-2 scores, we extracted several feature matrices for each recording and evaluated the system performance for each feature matrix. 

## Data pre-processing

The features (feature matrix of size 100x49 per recording) are normalized using the z-norm method (zero mean and unit variance), where the normalization is applied per feature on the whole train dataset, and the same mean and standard deviation are used to normalize the test datasets. We extracted five different feature matrices for each child by randomly selecting different subsets of vocalizations. We extracted 49 features of speech from each ADOS-2 recording. These included acoustic features (e.g., pitch, jitter, formants, bandwidth, energy, voicing, and spectral slope) and conversational features (e.g., mean vocalization duration and total number of vocalizations). 

To generate the features from your recording(s):
1. Navigate to `feature_extraction` folder.
2. Extract pitch+formants+bandwidths+voicing values:
   Open the `main_run_pitch_extraction_recs.py` and modify the `path_recs` and `save_path` to your specific paths. Adjust the pitch floor and ceiling to Your desired frequencies. This will extract pitch, two first formants and their bandwidths, and voicing of the pitch     (the amplitude). The pitch values will be saved in the `Pitch` folder in a file named `pitch_<rec_name>.txt`. The formants and their bandwidths will be saved in the `Formants` folder in one file named `formants_<rec_name>.txt`. The voicing values will be saved in the    `Voicing` folder in a file named `voicing_<rec_name>.txt`.
4. Install the feature extraction algorithm app (based on Matlab software), by running the `MyAppInstaller_web.exe`.
5. Launch the installed app.
6. Refer to `ASDspeech feature extraction app manual.pdf` for instructions on operating the app.

## Training

This process includes 5-fold cross-validation for each of the feature matrices, where each fold includes hyper-parameters tuning (learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs), testing the best parameters on the fifth fold, and performance evaluation using Pearson correlation, Root Mean Squared Error, Normalized RMSE, and Concordance Correlation Coefficient.

Code to run this part: `main_script.py`.

## Estimation/Prediction

This process includes the application of each trained model of each fold (5x5=25 models in total) on the two test datasets: Tim-point 1 and time-point 2. This step includes the estimation of the target score of each recording in time-point and performance evaluation.

The code to run this part is `estimate_recs_trained_mdl.py`.
